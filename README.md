Final Project using Python Special Skill Indonesia

In this analysis process, I use datasets sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gmudit/employer-data  . With the variables in the following dataset, I created 5 analysis questions :

1. At what age can an intern earn the highest salary?

2. Which department has the highest average salary?

3. Is there a relationship between work experience 

and salary?

4. Which department has the greatest salary variation?

5. Which age group is most likely to be in a particular position?



Cleaning Data :

1. Missing Value

2. Duplicate Data

3. Delete Over Space

4. Delete Invalid Value



Analysis :

1. Measuring Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)

2. Measuring Dispersion (Range, Interquartile, Standard Deviation)

3. Measuring Asymetric (Skewed)
